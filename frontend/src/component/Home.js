                    <p>WNTD Festive Neon Run is hosted by Sekretariat Green Lung USM in conjuction with the World No Tobacco Day, with themed
                        <b> "Breathe Clean, Smoke Free" </b> to emphasise the importance of being smoke-free and tobacco-free for our health.
                        The primary goal of the WNTD Festiva Neon Run is to raise awareness about the detrimental effects of tobacco use and to 
                        promote a healthier, smoke-free lifestyle. By aligning with World No Tobacco Day, 
                        the event seeks to educate the public on the dangers of smoking and the benefits of quitting. It serves as a powerful 
                        reminder of the importance of clean air and the positive impact of a tobacco-free environment on our health.
